Privileged white person
Please note that many of those opinions come from my experience collected during the pre-pandemic times. They probably do not fit very well to the current, extraordinary situation of many students. However, I hope that once the virus fades out, this blog post remains actual and useful.
## Which university
This is one of the most popular questions I am being asked directly or see posted on Reddit. The question is usually about the choice of the Master degree in one of those countries: the UK, Switzerland, Germany or Netherlands. While UK is popular for the large number of brilliant institutions such as Oxford, Cambridge, UCLA or Imperial College, many people are interested about the continental universities such as Delft, Zurich, EPFL, Amsterdam TUM, Freiburg or Tubignen.
The choice of university possibly includes factors such as the distance from your relatives, financial burden, language and the culture of the given country. 

People do have their bias. The hiring scale is probably slightly tipped if you come from an "elite" university or the same institution your interviewer finished.

## Should I do PhD or Not
I very much understand that some students my have hard time deciding whether they should decide for PhD or not. I sat down with several colleagues. Most of them held degrees from ETH, EPFL or TUM.
The biggest take-way from those conversations was: "Choose your environment well. Make sure, that you will be surrounded by brilliant people in a stimulating research lab." Apparently, one of the biggest traps may be ending up working alone on some isolated problem. One colleague did it under a super-star professor, which only meant that their relationship was very distant and formal, which exacerbated the resentment.

If your primary reason to pursue a PhD is to join the best research groups in Facebook or Google, I would argue whether your motivation is right.
On the other hand, one brilliant scientist and founder told me: "I will probably be doing engineering work for many, many years. In that perspective, three years of interesting research does not sound like a awfully big commitment.
Jeff Bezos described a simple, yet remarkably useful filter for making difficult decisions. Imagine your future self, old and wrinkled. From the perspective of an eighty-year old man, it is much easier to take a birds-eye view on your situation. Would old you regret not taking this particular decision? If the answer is yes, you should probably do it.
Even though I was in advanced discussions with some very cool supervisors, I ended up refusing to do my PhD.

I recognize the fact, that I tend to fall into various bias traps of my logic.

## I have too low grades to get to

Many students largely overestimates the importance of good grades. Good grades do correlate to some extend with many key engineering skills. If you score high on your exams you probably have the ability to understand the topic in-depth. Passing all the test in your exam period may show that you treat your responsibilities seriously and know how to organize yourself. Also, your future PhD supervisor may be interested in some results from particular subjects to make sure, that you possess a solid foundations in certain field.

However, I would strongly advise students to prioritize experience and hands-on experience over their GPA. I am fairly confident that this advice applies to everyone, including aspiring PhD students.
Recruiters and technical managers at companies usually do not care about your grades. Anegdotically, I heard about some peers were asked to attach their grades when applying to big consulting firms. Except for this one case, GPA is usually a nice thing to have on your resume (if you decide to even put it there). What companies usually value are (in not particular order) your technical skills, relevant experience, general problem solving ability and your attitude. 
Technical skills and relevant experience are something which you obtain through participation in university projects, hackathons, tech challenges or internships. If you want to build self-driving cars, it is important to understand the relevant topics from robotics, computer vision or control theory. Sound understanding does correlate with good grades. However, I think that in order for this knowledge to really sink in, you should ideally try to become a member of self-driving group, sign up for on-hands seminars or apply for an internship in autonomous driving company. Only once you really understand the bigger context of the theory, you become a valuable asset for the company.
General problem solving ability is something which is hard to learn and like intuition it builds up over time. Pattern recognition. Th Hackerranks tried to do but fail miserably.
Finally, the attitude. I think that while grades are being overestimated, the importance of your character is largely underestimated. You do not want to work with unpleasant people around you, no matter how smart they are. 
I really like what Art Chmielewski, the manager of NASA JPS, said about some students.

## Should I go to FANG or not
I believe that a young professional should essentially pursue one of the following two scenarios. As a fresh graduate you are probably yet free from many  responsibilities and can afford to take big risks. This is a good time to take "" bets and making your own idea work. But most of us choose to work normal jobs and that is fine. In that case focus on getting on a very steep learning curve, acquire new skills fast and try to find yourself surrounded by brilliant people. I would quote Art Chemielewski here once again: .
While I would like to be as much, I do not really find a good explanation why you should not pursue a career in "FANG-like" companies. You are likely to szeroka wode, collaborate with smart and experienced people plus getting cool benefits and above-average salary. The experience will possibly help you with your future career, whichever path you choose afterwards. "FANG-like" companies I do not mean exclusively Amazon, Facebook, Google etc. This kind of working environment can be usually found in fast growing, tech savvy, post-startup phase international offices.
